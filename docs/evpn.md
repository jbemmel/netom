# EVPN monitoring

Netom collects L2VPN EVPN (AFI 25, SAFI 70) from BGP and BMP, including
ADD-PATH sessions. Configure `L2VpnEvpn` in a BGP peer's `protocols` list;
BMP peers use the capabilities in their exported Peer Up messages.

EVPN routes live in a separate RIB. Overlapping tenant prefixes do not collide
with each other or with the global unicast table. Identity includes the route
type, wire-format route distinguisher (RD), route-specific key, and ingress
(including the ADD-PATH child). Type 2 identity excludes ESI and labels;
type 5 identity excludes ESI, gateway, and label. Changes to forwarding fields
replace the same route, and withdrawals match even when labels differ.
Peer Down, family-scoped withdrawals, and ingress cleanup include EVPN.

## Symmetric IRB

Inspect type 2 MAC/IP advertisements and type 5 IP prefix advertisements
together to monitor the MAC-VRF and IP-VRF views of a tenant. The decoder
exposes the RD, Ethernet tag, ESI, MAC, IPv4/IPv6 host or prefix, gateway,
and label fields. Both type 2 labels are preserved for deployments that
advertise a MAC-VRF label and an IP-VRF label.

The API also decodes route targets, the EVPN Router's MAC extended community,
and the MP_REACH next hop. Use a route target to select the routes associated
with a tenant across multiple advertising RDs. An RD distinguishes routes;
it is not a tenant membership or import-policy identifier. Route targets are
reported as advertised; Netom does not simulate VRF import policy or recursive
forwarding resolution.

Label fields are returned as **raw 24-bit integers**. For VXLAN these are
VNIs. For MPLS, decode the label-stack entry according to the encapsulation;
do not interpret the raw field as an MPLS label number. The API does not
infer which VNI is an L2 VNI or L3 VNI from its value alone.

## Query API

`GET /api/v1/ribs/l2vpnevpn/routes` returns `{"data": [...]}`. Each row has:

- `route`: `nlri`, retained `attributes`, `ingress_id`, `ltime`, and `active`;
- `overlay`: `route_targets`, `router_mac`, and `next_hop`;
- `source_ingress_id` and `path_id`: original session and optional ADD-PATH ID.

The `nlri.raw` byte array includes the route type and length header, allowing
inspection of fields not decoded by the API. Types 1, 3, and 4 are retained,
with RD and applicable tag/ESI fields decoded. Unknown route types with an RD
are preserved as opaque records and matched by their complete NLRI.

All filters below are optional and combine with AND:

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `rd` | Exact RD, e.g. `65000:100` or `192.0.2.1:100` |
| `route_target` | Exact advertised RT, e.g. `65000:100` |
| `route_type` | Numeric EVPN type, e.g. `2` or `5` |
| `vni` | Match either raw label field (for VXLAN monitoring) |
| `prefix` | Exact type 2 host or type 5 prefix |
| `ingress_id` | Exact stored ingress ID, including ADD-PATH child IDs |
| `include_withdrawn` | `true` includes retained withdrawn records; default `false` |

Unknown parameters are rejected. Withdrawn records are available only when
the RIB is configured to retain withdrawn attributes. A withdrawal preserves
the last announced attributes and forwarding fields.

```sh
curl -G http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/ribs/l2vpnevpn/routes \
  --data-urlencode 'route_target=65000:100' \
  --data-urlencode 'route_type=5'

curl -G http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/ribs/l2vpnevpn/routes \
  --data-urlencode 'rd=192.0.2.1:100' \
  --data-urlencode 'prefix=10.0.0.0/24'
```

The endpoint produces buffered JSON and takes a snapshot of the EVPN table;
large tables require memory proportional to the stored records and response.
It shares the concurrent query limit with other RIB queries.

## Pipeline support and limits

BMP output includes EVPN in live rebuilt updates and initial RIB dumps,
retaining next hops, communities, and ADD-PATH IDs. Synthetic Peer Up messages
and End-of-RIB markers include EVPN when advertised by the source peer.
BGP4MP MRT updates use the same decoder; TABLE_DUMP_V2 EVPN import is not
implemented. The existing CLI route commands and ClickHouse route schema do
not expose EVPN; use the HTTP API or BMP output.

Roto route filters can use `is_evpn()` and `evpn_rd()`. `fmt_prefix()` returns
the type 2 host or type 5 prefix; EVPN routes without an IP prefix return
`0.0.0.0/0`, so guard IP-only policies with `is_evpn()`.
