# Netom documentation

Netom is a programmable BGP and BMP engine maintained by FastNetMon. Connect
routing data sources, keep routes in an in-memory RIB, inspect them through
the CLI or HTTP API, and stream updates to other systems.

Start with the [quickstart](quickstart.md) to run a BMP collector, then use
the [configuration guide](configuration.md) to connect the components you need.
The [CLI guide](cli.md) covers day-to-day inspection; the
[RIB query API](rib-query-api.md) covers automation and route exports.

This manual follows the `main` branch. Netom is under active development;
configuration and API details can change between 0.x versions. See
[releases](releases.md) for package platforms and the publishing process.
